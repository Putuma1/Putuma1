- 👋 Hi, I’m @Putuma1, a scientist, mass spectrometrist and clinical chemist.
- 👀 I’m new to actual programming in machine learning, but I check all sorts of projects, mostly written in Python and maybe R.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning applications in chemistry, life sciences and multi-omics
- 💞️ Eventually, I hope to collaborate and only then I'll update this README when my programming is up to par enough for your time.
- 📫 putuma.gqamana@gmail.com is my email. I do have a work email, but that will follow as my interactions here get to be more serious.
